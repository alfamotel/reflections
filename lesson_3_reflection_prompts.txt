When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To share with others
    To share between machines
    To have a backup copy

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Better control and no 'unexpected' behaviour

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork when you want to build on someone else's work and recognise the source
    Fork if you can not modify the source
    Clone to make a local copy
    Clone to work locally on a remote copy
    Branch if you want to make changes and leave a master copy intact
    Branch if you want to experiment

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally allows
    you to keep track of the difference with the remote without requiring
    online access.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Working on a shared files system or dropbox/google drive/etc.
    Easier because less learning curve, but not as robust
    There would be no worklfow

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    If the changes profoundly affect the master branch
    Direct changes to the master are easier to manage but riskier
    Branches harder to handle but safer since the master is untouched
